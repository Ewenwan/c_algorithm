# Dynamic Programming

<!-- This is Comment -->

## 概念
DP = Subproblems + "Reuse"

## Fabonacci numbers:

$$ F_1 = F_2 = 1 $$
$$ F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} $$

* compute
$$ F_n $$

### Memorized DP Algorithm

#### DP = Recursion + memorization
* Re-use solutions to subprolems that help solve the problem
* Running Time:
 T_t = \#subproblems * time_{subproblem} $$
* Ignore  recursive calls 

### Bottom-up Dynamic Programming
* Can save storage: only remember the nearest two numbers.

## Shortest paths
Signle Shortest path

### A tool
Gaussing
Tring all guessions, Taking the best one.

### DP = Recursion + memorization + Guessing
Storing the shortest path in a 2D table
